	<h1>Kodungallur Bhagavathy Temple, Kerala: Abusing The Goddess</h1>
	<img src="four.jpg" alt="Kodungallur Bhagavathy picture" width="30%" height="30%" >
	<ul style="font-size: 140%; text-align: left;"><li>The earthly abode of Goddess Bhadrakali, a gentler reincarnation of Goddess Kali, the Kodungallur Bhagavathy Temple witnesses a bizarre seven-day festival celebrated annually, the Bharani Festival. Men and women wearing red apparel and carrying swords swarm this Indian temple, running around in a trance-like state. They hit their heads with the sword, blood pours freely, and they enter the temple hurling choice abuses and singing lewd songs about the Devi.</li><br>
	<li>Offerings are not made in the general fashion, instead, they are thrown at the statue of the goddess, and the temple rafters are hit repeatedly with sticks. The temple is shut down for 7 days after the festival, admittedly to clean the blood stains. Due to this festival, it is now one of the famous temples in Kerala.</li></ul>
